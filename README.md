## About

The purpose of this project is to reverse-engineer ***Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X*** in order to rebuild its codebase and allow for multiple different uses of it. More specifically, the PlayStation 2 version of the game released in North America (identifiable by its serial number, **SLUS-20184**) is being decompiled due to the presence of DWARF format debugging data in the PS2 executable, as well as the relative ease of reconstructing MIPS assembly back to the C language as opposed to other, more complex types of architectures. 

While function matching with [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) is the preferred method of decompilation, the project does not compile an ELF binary that's identical bit for bit to the one found on the game disk. RE: CVX was developed with the MetroWerks CodeWarrior IDE, and MWCC does not feature an equivalent to GCC's INCLUDE_ASM functionality which renders the process of building a matching binary less flexible. Instead, the current build system produces an executable which only contains the code that has been decompiled so far, and the resulting ELF can be run on a repackaged DVD image of the game that is bootable on the PCSX2 emulator (and technically should also work on an actual PS2 console).

Additionally, this project also consists of reverse-engineering the CRI Middleware library that was employed by the developers to handle different aspects of the game such as audio and the AFS filesystem. There is also an on-going [decompilation of the Nintendo GameCube version](https://github.com/fmil95/recvx-gc-decomp), which does compile a matching binary so if you prefer that setup and have some knowledge of PowerPC and don't mind working with less debug info, feel free to contribute to that one instead. The [Dreamcast version is being decompiled](https://github.com/fmil95/recv-dc-decomp), too, but even though it can build a matching executable, the tools for decompiling games for that platform need to be expanded upon greatly.

## Building

The very first step should be to clone the repository: 
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AshfordFamily/recvx-decomp.git
```

Next you have to place your copy of the SLUS_201.84 file in the config folder. The setup now depends on whether you want to use a dev container or not.

### With Dev Container

If you're using an IDE that supports [dev containers](https://containers.dev/), such as Visual Studio Code, you can simply open the repository with as a dev container. 

You will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) installed and running on your machine to open a dev container.

### Without Dev Container

Requisites:
- Python
- MIPS Binutils
- wibo (if using Linux, for running Windows binaries)

Install splat with the following command: 
```
pip install -r config/requirements.txt
```

---

**Follow these instructions after entering the dev container or installing the requisites:**

Use the following command to setup objdiff:
```
python compile.py --setup
```

Either command should run without errors and generate an `objdiff.json` project file or a `config/asm` folder respectively.

From now on to build the project you just need to type the following command:
```
python compile.py
```

If you're using Linux, an installation of wibo is needed in order to run the Windows-only MWCC binary, 
a small prompt with install steps will be shown if the script can't find wibo in your path.

With the main.elf from compilation, you can repackage RE: CVX's ISO file with it to see the decompiled code in action. You need to put your copy of the game's DVD on the iso folder, and dump its contents with the following command:
```
python mkiso.py -m extract --iso iso/RE_CVX.iso
```

Then rebuild the disk with:
```
python mkiso.py -m insert
```

If successful, you will now see an ISO called "RECVX_NEW" in the iso folder that you can use to test the results with an emulator (preferrably PCSX2 for its debugging capabilities) or console.
